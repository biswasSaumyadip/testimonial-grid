              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company
              I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

              ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a transition and
              have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
              it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best‚Äîand most grueling‚Äîtime of
              my life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
              at a VR startup. ‚Äù

            ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
            who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
            can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
            outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
            often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
            land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
